# SwiftUtility

A description of this package.

This Package Manager is included in Swift 3.0 and above.

==========================================================================
### Add a Package Dependency

To add a package dependency to your Xcode project, select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency and enter its repository URL. You can also navigate to your target’s General pane, and in the “Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content” section, click the + button, select Add Other, and choose Add Package Dependency.

Instead of adding a repository URL, you can search for a package on GitHub or GitHub Enterprise. Add your GitHub or GitHub Enterprise account in Xcode’s preferences, and a list of package repositories appears as you type. The following screenshot shows a list of repositories for the search term ExamplePackage for a user who added their Git provider in Xcode’s preferences.

If you’ve added a source control account in Xcode’s preferences and you haven’t yet entered a search term, the list contains package repositories from:
- Your Git Repositories
- Your teams’ Git repositories
- Your starred repositories on GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, or your self-managed GitLab instance

==========================================================================
### Use Features and Assets Provided by a Swift Package

To use a Swift package’s functionality in your app, import a package’s product as a Swift module.

==========================================================================
### Edit a Package Dependency

You can’t edit the content of your package dependencies directly. If you want to make changes to a package dependency, you need to add it as a local package to your project. 

==========================================================================
### Delete a Package Dependency

If you need to remove a package dependency from your Xcode project, navigate to the Swift Packages pane in the settings, then select the Swift package from the list of packages. Click the - button to remove the selected package dependency.
